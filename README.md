# Sentiment Analysis Using BERT

### Overview
This project uses **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, a state-of-the-art NLP model, to perform sentiment analysis on text data. The goal is to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment based on the input. BERT's advanced language understanding helps achieve high accuracy in detecting sentiment nuances, making it ideal for applications such as product reviews, social media analysis, and customer feedback.

### Features
- **BERT Model:** Leveraging pre-trained BERT for text classification.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, padding, and encoding input data using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.
- **Fine-tuning:** Fine-tuning BERT on a custom sentiment dataset to improve accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model performance evaluation.
- **Inference:** User-friendly script to input custom text for sentiment prediction.

### Technologies Used
- **Python** for core programming
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for pre-trained BERT and fine-tuning
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** for model training
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling
- **Matplotlib** for visualization of model performance
